Introduction
The "Principle of Proportional Ink" in data visualization states that the amount of ink used to represent a data point should be directly proportional to the magnitude of the value being represented. This principle ensures clarity and fairness in data representation. This project aims to demonstrate and explore this principle through practical examples using Python's Matplotlib library.

Theoretical Background
Definition of the Principle of Proportional Ink
The Principle of Proportional Ink is a guideline in data visualization that states the amount of ink (or pixels, in digital format) used to represent a data point should be directly proportional to the numerical value it represents. This principle ensures that the visual weight of a data point accurately and fairly reflects its actual value. It's a subset of the broader concept of data-ink ratio, a term coined by Edward Tufte, which emphasizes minimizing non-essential ink to focus on the data itself.

Importance in Data Visualization
Accuracy: Ensures that the visualization accurately represents the data, preventing misinterpretation.
Efficiency: By reducing non-essential ink, it focuses the viewer's attention on the actual data.
Clarity: Improves the readability and understandability of the chart or graph.
Fairness: Prevents the exaggeration of certain data points, ensuring a fair representation of all values.
In summary, the Principle of Proportional Ink is crucial for creating honest, effective, and clear visualizations. It works in tandem with other principles to enhance the overall integrity and effectiveness of data visualization.

Examples
The following example intentionally distorts the visualization to represent incorrect principles. It exaggerates the y-axis scale and uses misleading labels and titles.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
months = range(1, 13)  # Representing 12 months
sales = [45, 50, 55, 40, 65, 60, 75, 70, 85, 80, 95, 100]

# Creating a line graph with misleading y-axis scale
plt.plot(months, [x * 100 for x in sales], marker='o', color='red')  # Exaggerated y-axis scale

# Adding misleading titles and labels
plt.title('Skyrocketing Monthly Sales Trend')  # Misleading title
plt.xlabel('Time (in centuries)')  # Misleading x-axis label
plt.ylabel('Sales (in billions)')  # Misleading y-axis label

# Display the misleading plot
plt.show()

Preview
In the code, the y-axis scale is exaggerated by multiplying each data point by 100 ([x * 100 for x in sales]). This exaggeration artificially inflates the sales values, making them appear much larger than they actually are. This distortion can mislead viewers by implying significant growth or sales figures that are not accurate.

The title of the graph, "Skyrocketing Monthly Sales Trend," is misleading because it suggests a substantial and unrealistic increase in sales. Similarly, the x-axis label "Time (in centuries)" and the y-axis label "Sales (in billions)" provide incorrect context and units, further contributing to the misrepresentation of data.

The use of markers ('o') and the color 'red' can also be misleading because they draw attention to individual data points, making the exaggerated scale more visually pronounced. Inaccurate color and marker choices can distort the viewer's perception of the data.

The intention behind this code is to highlight the importance of ethical and accurate data visualization. By deliberately misrepresenting data, it demonstrates how visual cues and labeling choices can significantly impact the interpretation of information. In practice, data should always be presented accurately and transparently to ensure that viewers can make informed decisions based on reliable information. Misleading visualizations can lead to misunderstandings, misinformed decisions, and a loss of trust in the data source.

Another illustrative instance involving politicians can be observed in the following image depicting the outcomes of a party preference survey. Do you discern a prominent presence of the color blue? Indeed, the utilization of blue ink to signify 20.5% of the data is substantially greater than the red ink employed to denote the 20% statistic.

When generating your own visualizations, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of integrity and accuracy, avoiding any form of manipulation or deceit in the construction of plots and charts.

Examples
Basic Examples with Matplotlib
Below are examples using Python's Matplotlib library to create a bar chart and a line graph, both adhering to this principle.

1. Bar Chart Example
Objective: To represent sales data for different products using a bar chart.

Python Code Example:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
products = ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C', 'Product D']
sales = [50, 30, 80, 40]

# Creating a bar chart
plt.bar(products, sales, color='blue')

# Adding titles and labels
plt.title('Sales by Product')
plt.xlabel('Products')
plt.ylabel('Sales')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Preview
Rationale:

Proportional Representation: The height of each bar is directly proportional to the sales figures.
Color Choice: A single color is used to avoid unnecessary distractions and focus on the data.
Labels and Title: Clearly indicate what the data represents.
2. Line Graph Example
Objective: To show the trend of monthly sales over a year.

Python Code Example:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
months = range(1, 13)  # Representing 12 months
sales = [45, 50, 55, 40, 65, 60, 75, 70, 85, 80, 95, 100]

# Creating a line graph
plt.plot(months, sales, marker='o', color='green')

# Adding titles and labels
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trend')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Preview
Rationale:

Proportional Representation: The position of each point on the line graph corresponds to the monthly sales, with the y-axis representing the sales figures.
Use of Markers: Markers at each data point make it clear where the actual data points are, enhancing readability.
Consistent Scale: The y-axis is scaled to ensure that the visual representation of sales figures is proportional.
In both examples, adherence to the Principle of Proportional Ink is evident in the way the visual elements (bar height in the bar chart and line position in the line graph) directly and accurately represent the data. The simplicity of the design, avoidance of unnecessary decorative elements, and clear labeling all contribute to making these visualizations effective and aligned with the principle.

Broken scales show drama where it doesn't exist
This is probably the most common way graphics lie, whether intentional or not.

The original graphic (left side) was shown by TVE, the Spanish public broadcasting system, in September 2013, showing the unemployment rates in Spain. In this case, it's not just the Y-axis that was truncated, the problem is where the X-axis begins.

We can redraw it (right side), but this time showing the whole picture. This new 12-month graph show us what really happens, as we just see few months, with seasonal variations.


Preview
It gets worse when we compare two different elements. In this case we're not just adding drama to the change, we're making unfair comparisons.

The following graph of Presidential election results in Venezuela, is based on a graphic by Venezonala de Televisi√≥n. Notice the truncated Y-axis which greatly distorts the difference between the percentages of vote (left side).

An alternative version of this graph is shown at the right. Which has a new 0-baseline and the 3D effect was removed.


Preview
Ignoring population size makes rates impossible to compare
When we're talking about where people live it's important to have in mind how many people live there.

Let's analyze the following example of Most dangerous cities based on murders in 2014.


Preview
Chicago and New York suffered more murders in 2014 than Detroit, that's right. But that doesn't mean they're more dangerous. If we look at how many people live in each city, the comparison changes greatly.

Which cities have the highest number of murders? Not the most dangerous, but the most populated. More people will imply more everything.
