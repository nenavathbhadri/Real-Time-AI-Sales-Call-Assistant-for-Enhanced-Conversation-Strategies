Quiz
8
How does ensemble learning improve model performance?


The models in an ensemble are trained independently, and their predictions are combined in some way to produce the final output.


The classification models in an ensemble are trained independently, and their predictions are combined by simply taking the average of their predictions.

Given a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem, how would you compute the precision score?


Precision = False Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)


Precision = True Positives / False Positives


Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)


Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + True Negatives)

Correct!

LetÂ´s suppose three classifications model are built to discriminate apples from bananas. The following table shows the results obtained according to these algorithms:

model	Model 1	Model 2	Model 3
Accuracy (training)	0.99	0.93	0.99
Accuracy (testing)	0.90	0.75	0.10

Model 2 fits better a High Variance scenario


Model 3 fits better a High Variance scenario


Model 3 fits better a High Bias scenario


Model 1 fits better a High Bias scenario

Correct!
