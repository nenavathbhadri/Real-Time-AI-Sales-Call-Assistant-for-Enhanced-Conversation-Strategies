Use GridSearchCV to search over a range of values for max_depth (from 1 to 20) and n_estimators (from 1 to 10) hyperparameters to find the combination that yields the best performance.

For this task use cv=5, and random_state=42 and compute the Best mean score


Best hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 4, 'min_samples_leaf': 2} with a mean score of 0.70


Best hyperparameters:{'max_depth': 4, 'min_samples_leaf': 4} with a mean score of 0.96


Best hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 3, 'min_samples_leaf': 5} with a mean score of 0.70


Best hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 8, 'min_samples_leaf': 12}with a mean score of 0.75

Correct!  3
True or False: For this example, the best hyperparameter obtained is max_depth = 19


True


False

Correct!
