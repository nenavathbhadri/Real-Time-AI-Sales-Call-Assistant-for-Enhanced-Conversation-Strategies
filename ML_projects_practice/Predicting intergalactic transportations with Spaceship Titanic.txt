Your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. But due to an unexpected malfunction, some of the passengers got transported to a different Galaxy!

You'll need to use your Machine Learning skills to predict who got Transported and who didn't. Let's get started!

Important: these activities are designed to be run in order.

The Data
Start your lab and take a look at the data we're loading from spaceship_passengers.csv. The target variable is called Transported and it indicates (True/False) if the passenger has been mistakenly transported to a different dimension or not.

Syntax	Description
PassengerId	A unique Id for each passenger
Name	The first and last names of the passenger
HomePlanet	The planet the passenger departed from
CryoSleep	Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage
Destination	The planet the passenger will be debarking to
Age	The age of the passenger
VIP	Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage
RoomService	Amount the passenger has been billed for this service
FoodCourt	Amount the passenger has been billed for this service
ShoppingMall	Amount the passenger has been billed for this service
Spa	Amount the passenger has been billed for this service
VRDeck	Amount the passenger has been billed for this service
CabinDeck	Passenger's cabin deck
CabinNumber	Passenger's cabin number
CabinSide	Passenger's cabin side, can be either P for Port or S for Starboard
Transported	Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension or not
Data Cleaning
1
How many null/missing values has the column CryoSleep?

217
Correct!

2
How many null/missing values has the column FoodCourt?

183

3
How many null/missing values has the column PassengerId?

0

4
Fill the null/missing values in Destination with the most common value

Find the most common destination in the Destination column, and fill the null values with it. Perform the fixes in place, modifying the df variable.

Correct!

5
Fill the null/missing values in RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa and VRDeck with the median

You must modify the df variable itself. Don't worry if you screw up with the DataFrame! just reload it with the first line of the notebook.

6
Fill the null/missing values in VIP with the most common value

Find the most common value for the VIP column, and fill the null values with it. Perform the fixes in place, modifying the df variable.

7
What variables (columns) are independent and should be dropped before moving forward?

There are a few variables in the dataset that are independent and won't contribute to a good prediction for our final model, which ones are them?


ShoppingMall


Destination


PassengerId


HomePlanet


Name


CabinDeck

Correct!

8
Drop the previously defined columns

Drop the columns that you have previously identified as independent. Perform your drop inplace, modifying the df variable. If you have made a mistake, restart your notebook from the beginning.

Correct!

9
Drop any other row that contains a null value

Drop any other row containing a null/NaN value. The final dataframe should have NO null values whatsoever.

What features should be encoded?

What categorical features should be encoded before training our model?

11
Encode the features previously identified in its own dataframe

Given the features previously identified as categorical and that need to be encoded, encode them in a new dataframe named df_encoded. IMPORTANT. Do not modify df yet, it should be a brand new DataFrame with only the previously selected values in coded as one-hot values, tht is, 1s and 0s.

Don't perform any name changes to the columns; for example, the encoded columns for CryoSleep will be CryoSleep_False and CryoSleep_True. For HomePlanet they'll be HomePlanet_Earth, HomePlanet_Europa, HomePlanet_Mars, etc.

Important! You will (most likely) need to transform your the VIP column to an object/string before encoding it. Use the .astype(str) method before encoding.

Correct!

12
Remove the original encoded features from df

Now it's time to remove from df the original features you have previously identified as categorical and encoded. But, this time, don't remove them from df. Create a NEW variable named df_no_categorical that contains the results of the drop operation.

Correct!

13
Create a new dataframe combining df_no_categorical and df_encoded

Create a new DataFrame in the variable df_final that contains the combination of the two previously processed dataframes: df_no_categorical and df_encoded, in that order.

The result will look something like:

14
Finally, separate the target variable Transported from the training data

Using df_final, which contains all our data correctly cleaned and prepared, create two new derivative variables:

The transported variable should be a Series containing ONLY the Transported column.

The df_train variable should be a dataframe containing ALL the columns in df_final, EXCEPT for the Transported column. This is equivalent of saying: "remove the Transported column from df_final and store it in df_train.

Important: DO NOT modify df_final.
